# Team Fee Tracker

A small React single-page app for managing teams and people with management fee calculations. Built with plain JavaScript, React, ReactDOM, and Tailwind via CDN. Data is stored in `localStorage` so it persists between refreshes.

## Run

The app provides:
- CRUD for teams
- CRUD for people within a selected team
- Editable management fee percentages (global default, per team, per person)
- Summary bar showing total headcount and total management fee
